The [Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) collection and the second [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens) collection, grant owners full access to a russian-speaking [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rk7VVUbHWX), created by YouTuber [Defi Geek](https://www.youtube.com/@defigeek),known in the community as DeFi Geek or Master Geek.

> The [DeFi Geeks Member Gen 1](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1k6gdkepvwhhhdt6tk0auvkvansd3muqy0p98yedgwwarvcycxh8sex8dsf) collection is the most affordable collection. It provides the [**Gen1 member**](#gen1-member) role, which keeps you updated on the latest news, activities, and airdrops. It also allows you to participate in giveaways. Depending on rarity, it offers additional [bonuses](#gen1-member). This is a starting point for exploring the community, and its low cost helps filter out inappropriate users.
Owners of any [Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) or [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens) NFT also get a free VPN (30GB/month), working well even in China or Russia.

Owners of the first collection have already received free NFTs from [Expedition](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/expeditionpics/tokens). 
Each NFT in the collection has unique attributes that enhance participation in monthly giveaways. For example, some attributes can enable sharing in VPN sales revenue or increase rewards in poker tournaments.


# Discord Server
The [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rk7VVUbHWX) is a hub for announcements about airdrops, crypto news, giveaways, interviews with crypto projects, and friendly discussions. Enthusiasts gather weekly for poker games, and several giveaways are held monthly. Topics are divided into different channels to make it easier to find the information you need.

To help new members navigate the server, the Master Geek has created three detailed guides:

# The Main rule - to take part in a giveaway, you can hold only one NFT from the collection.
All giveaways are held on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rk7VVUbHWX) in the #main-giveaway and #dao-giveaway channels.

### Prohibited:
- **Holding two or more** NFTs from the same collection ([Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) or [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens)).
- Creating **multiple accounts**.

  All cheaters will permanently lose the ability to participate in giveaways.

### Exceptions
- **First:** [Dark Geek](#ghostwalker) - the rarest NFT from the [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens)) collection. Holders of this NFT are granted the Ghostwalker role, which allows them to hold an unlimited number of NFTs on their account without losing eligibility for giveaways.
- **Second:** If you own one NFT from each collection ([Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) and [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens)), you receive the [T-800 role](#t-800). This role allows you to hold one NFT from each collection on the same account and still participate in giveaways.

  It was introduced to increase the value of the first collection. By adding one NFT from the second collection to any NFT from the first, you can participate in multiple giveaways:
  - Giveaways for the first collection ([Set 1](#set-1)).
  - Giveaways for the second collection ([Set 2](#set-2)).
  - Exclusive giveaways for [T-800 role](#t-800) holders (owning one NFT from both collections).
<br>
 
- **[DeFi Geeks Member Gen 1](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1k6gdkepvwhhhdt6tk0auvkvansd3muqy0p98yedgwwarvcycxh8sex8dsf) collection:** You can hold an unlimited number of NFTs from this collection on your account. However, this provides no additional benefits or advantages. It is recommended to keep only one NFT for practicality.
<br><br>

### Giveaway Frequency
- **Main Giveaway:** Held every month without fail.
- **T-800 and other special roles:** These giveaways depend on various circumstances and are not conducted every month.


# Attributes and Roles

Each NFT has a set of attributes that grant access to specific roles on the server, unlocking additional features and opportunities.

Many attributes are still undisclosed, and owners of the first and second collections have the ability to propose ideas and approve them through community voting. Each user can have multiple roles on the server.

The attributes of each NFT are displayed on its page beneath the image.

# Alchemist
Activated by Attribute: Cosmic Pump Potion
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/bJ950mVD/Alchemist.jpg)

Increases giveaway chances. If an **Alchemist** wins in the #main-giveaway, he receive 6 additional tickets for any giveaways in the following month. Also the **Alchemist** can select one additional role to receive the same 6 extra tickets for the next giveaways. 

However, since **Alchemist** is a kind-hearted geek, his beliefs prevent him from choosing bad geeks: [Destroyer](#destroyer), [Trapper](#trapper), or [Punisher](#punisher).

Example: If the Alchemist grants the extra tickets to the [**Predictor**](#predictor) role, the [**Predictor**](#predictor) will have 8 tickets (2 from its own attributes + 6 additional).

This boost for both roles is active for one month only and cannot trigger two months in a row. If the **Alchemist** wins the #main-giveaway again on next month, he simply claim the prize, and the boost does not activate.

Plus, **Alchemist** has privileges in IDO with access to allocations and a chance to win additional prizes.

Master Geek created a fund of 20,000 Eclipse to secure a guaranteed allocation of $500 and a chance to win an additional $1,250 through 16 tickets.

Ticket Distribution:
-  2 tickets – for [**Gen1 members**](#gen1-members)
-  14 tickets – for holders of DeFi Geeks NFT

Owners of the **Alchemist** role receive 7 of these tickets. If there are fewer tickets, they will be raffled among them. If there are more, the remaining tickets will be distributed among other roles through a lottery.

Winners will receive  a mini-ticket, which grants the right to purchase a part of the IDO tokens. The tokens will be unlocked in stages: initially 20-30%, with the remainder gradually released over the next few months. You can buy tokens right away, and the rest will be distributed later.

To receive an allocation in Eclipse, you need to win twice: once in our giveaway and once in the distribution on the Eclipse platform. If you're lucky both times, you will need to transfer ~10-25 USDC to Master Geek to redeem the tokens. You won’t need to go through KYC or freeze funds — Master Geek has already done that for you.

# Angel
Activated by Attribute: Nimb
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/9QRmGXr7/Angel.jpg)

[[up](#list-of-roles)]


# Atom-master
Activated by Attribute: Atom
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/pdKP60QV/Atom-Master.jpg)

If this geek wins a giveaway, his reward in ATOM increases in 5 times. His closest counterpart is [**Tia-master**](#tia-master).

# Briber
Activated by Attribute: Defi Puppet
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/503bx6kZ/Briber.jpg)

Participates in advertising integrations on the server and acts as an ally to [**Destroyer**](#destroyer), avoiding his abilities. This role discusses and negotiates advertising integrations and, if approved by the Master Geek, receives 10% of their value.

[[up](#list-of-roles)]

# Btcz Maxi  
Activated by the attribute: Bitcoin  
![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blajack/DeFi-Geek-NFT/main/assets/img/_BTC.jpg)

The Master Geek believes the "real BTC" is Zcash, which, like Bitcoin, has a limited supply of 21 million but provides enhanced privacy.  

If this role wins the #main-giveaway, the holder receives $20 in Zcash via a shielded transfer, avoiding the 10% tax for [Crypto Tzar](#crypto-tzar). 

- **Cumulative Effect:** Rewards increase with consecutive wins:  
  - 1st win: **$20**  
  - 2nd consecutive win: **$40**  
  - 3rd consecutive win: **$80**  
  - 4th consecutive win: **$160**  
  - 5th consecutive win: **$320** (maximum reward reached).  

**Note:** This role is connected to Bitcoin; further details will be announced later.  
[[up](#list-of-roles)]


# Cosmic Gambler
Activated by Attribute: Bluffing Cap
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/4dZXkzw6/Bluffing-Cap.jpg)
Winning poker tournaments increases your prize:
- 1st place — +3 TIA,
- 2nd place — +2 TIA,
- 3rd place — +1 TIA.

Prize boosts apply to 2 tournaments per month only:
- Tournaments with a 1 TIA entry fee.
- Freeroll by the Geek.

Additionally, it provides extra bonuses in blockchain games where the DeFi Geeks community actively participates.

[[up](#list-of-roles)]


# Cosmoleaser
Activated by Attribute: Celestial Disk
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/K8BXG11J/Celestial-Disk.jpg)

Master Geek has created a special wallet containing various NFTs for airdrops. If this wallet receives any airdrops, the Cosmoleaser roleholders are entitled to a share of the rewards.

Additionally, Master Geek owns a collection of NFTs that can be used in various services. Many of these NFTs remain unused, and holders of this role can borrow them for a time.

[[up](#list-of-roles)]


# Crypto-tzar
Activated by Attribute: Crown
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/8cj3qc8d/crown.jpg)

Holders of the Crown attribute gain the special role of **Crypto-tzar**. At the start of each month, a separate giveaway is held among **Crypto-tzar** holders to determine the **Czar of the Month**.

The **Czar of the Month** wields the right to demand a “tithe” — 10% of all winnings from DAO Holders (NFT Geeks owners) who win giveaways. However, the Czar does not touch the prizes won by [**Gen1 member**](#gen1-member).

Additionally, the **Czar of the Month** selects a favored role, granting it access to giveaways it normally wouldn’t qualify for. The Master Geek will randomly add the favored role to eligible giveaways.

If a participant with the Crypto-tzar role wins the main giveaway, they simply claim the prize outright. Their royal lineage exempts them from paying any tithe — not even to the Czar of the Month.


[[up](#list-of-roles)]


# Currency Master
Activated by Attribute: Scarf и DeFi Geek Master
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/PxRhLBT4/scarf-geekmaster.jpg)

This role, symbolized by a golden scarf, represents value and community growth. Its main purpose is to attract new members to the server and guide them. In the second collection, this responsibility is carried out by a character with the DeFi Geek Master attribute.

By helping recruit and integrate newcomers, holders of this role earn a share of the revenue generated from sales of the [NFT DeFI Geek Member Gen1.](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1k6gdkepvwhhhdt6tk0auvkvansd3muqy0p98yedgwwarvcycxh8sex8dsf). Additionally, one member is selected through a lottery to receive a special prize. Rewards are distributed in ATOM, which also benefits [**Crypto-tzar**](#crypto-tzar) roleholders, as they receive their customary "tithe."

[[up](#list-of-roles)]


# Destroyer
Activated by Attribute: Exoplanetary Devastation
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/sgrzZPdt/destroyer.jpg)

At the end of each month,hosts giveaways for owners of [Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) and [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens) collections. If the **Destroyer** wins, hi disable all special abilities of other participants for the following month, except for [**Briber**](#briber) and [**Protector**](#protector). However, its action activates the abilities of the [**Looter**](#looter) and [**Reanimator**](#reanimator) roles.

This destructive power cannot be triggered two months in a row. If the **Destroyer** wins again the next month, he only claim the prize without activating his ability.

[[up](#list-of-roles)]


# Diplomat
Activated by Attribute: Cigarette
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/d1pPQrjN/diplomat.jpg)

This role allows holders to share their referral links during the first six hours after a video is released on the [DeFi Geek YouTube]((https://www.youtube.com/@defigeek)) channel, enabling them to grow their network through referrals. The winner with this role will work closely with Master Geek throughout the month.

If the Master Geek earns rewards for bringing in referrals to a project, the Diplomat is the first in line to claim a share of those rewards.

 holders can claim 50% of the allocation, provided they win a ticket on the server and that same ticket also wins in the IDO process. Rewards will be distributed in multiple stages.

In the IDO lottery, the Diplomat can receive 50% of an IDO allocation. To do so, they must first win a ticket on the server, and that ticket must also win in the IDO itself. Rewards will be distributed in several stages. Note that the [Alchemist](#alchemist) role has priority in this activity—check their description for details.

# Drop Harvester
Activated by Attribute: Airdrop Cap
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/GpDp13RC/airdrop-Cap.jpg)

If **Ghostwalker** wins the main giveaway, the owner can choose any Geek (NFT) from their collection, and the abilities of that specific character will activate within the main giveaway. **Ghostwalker** also has the right to decline choosing anyone and simply claim their prize.

[[up](#list-of-roles)]

# Mindsmoker
Activated by Attribute: Headsmoke
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/d3sd1ZQd/headsmoker.jpg)

This role actively participates in all server activities, especially those related to NFTs. Initially, only 8 NFTs granted this role, giving holders priority access to any White List (WL).

With the release of the second collection NFT, the number of geeks with the **Mindsmoker** role has increased. **Mindsmokers** no longer have guaranteed access to WL spots. Instead, they now need to win them through giveaways.

A significant portion of WL spots will still be reserved for **Mindsmokers**. The exact number of spots will depend on the specific collaboration with the NFT collection. So if you love the hype and activity surrounding NFTs, this role is definitely for you.

The role has a "Karma" system. Before allocating WL spots, the Master Geek will ask if you plan to mint the collection. If you confirm and make it, you earn positive karma. If you fail to mint, you receive negative karma. The higher your karma, the higher your priority for WL allocation next time.

This role holds a special plant that allows it to copy any desired attribute from other geeks (except for the role of [Ghostwalker](#ghostwalker)) while keeping its own attributes unchanged.

The plant becomes usable once a year, on April 20th (Bitcoin halving day). The owner must pre-select which attribute he want to copy in advance to acquire it on this date.

The copied attribute remains active for exactly one year. After this period, the owner can either select a new attribute or keep the current one. If a new attribute is chosen, the previously copied one disappears.
