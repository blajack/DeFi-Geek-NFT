The [Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) collection and the second [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens) collection, grant owners full access to a russian-speaking [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rk7VVUbHWX), created by YouTuber [Defi Geek](https://www.youtube.com/@defigeek),known in the community as DeFi Geek or Main Geek.

> The [DeFi Geeks Member Gen 1](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1k6gdkepvwhhhdt6tk0auvkvansd3muqy0p98yedgwwarvcycxh8sex8dsf) collection is the most affordable collection. It provides the [**Gen1 member**](#gen1-member) role, which keeps you updated on the latest news, activities, and airdrops. It also allows you to participate in giveaways. Depending on rarity, it offers additional [bonuses](#gen1-member). This is a starting point for exploring the community, and its low cost helps filter out inappropriate users.
Owners of any [Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) or [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens) NFT also get a free VPN (30GB/month), working well even in China or Russia.

Owners of the first collection have already received free NFTs from [Expedition](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/expeditionpics/tokens). 
Each NFT in the collection has unique attributes that enhance participation in monthly giveaways. For example, some attributes can enable sharing in VPN sales revenue or increase rewards in poker tournaments.


# Discord Server
The [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Rk7VVUbHWX) is a hub for announcements about airdrops, crypto news, giveaways, interviews with crypto projects, and friendly discussions. Enthusiasts gather weekly for poker games, and several giveaways are held monthly. Topics are divided into different channels to make it easier to find the information you need.

To help new members navigate the server, the Main Geek has created three detailed guides:
- Video 1: [Introductions and Roles](https://youtu.be/s6S_VWan3sQ)       
- Video 2: [NFT Attributes](https://youtu.be/0yUOt1LdksI)       
- Video 3: [Airdrop](https://youtu.be/F2qTOG68bpM)

# The Main rule - to take part in a giveaway, you can hold only one NFT from the collection.

Giveaways take place in the #main-giveaway and #dao-giveaway channels. 

**Key Rules:**
- You can hold only one NFT from each collection on a single account.
- Creating multiple accounts is prohibited.
- Holding two or more NFTs from one collections on one account makes you ineligible for the giveaways.
- Users who try to cheat with multiple accounts lose access to giveaways entirely.

To participate, you can hold no more than one NFT from the [Defi Geeks](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1mg2hg6gppf78svvntya2065tvpuhfx6qf6zmv2z0n8hclpap7ycszq8v22/tokens) or [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens) collections on a single account.

**Exception: Ghostwalker Role**

If you own an NFT from the [Defi Geeks Survivers](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lpgyddvhl4xvkcgmvfln05cl45q8s6wfx02fsg9cuwune5al6srsl687cr/tokens) collection featuring a dark geek (the rarest NFT), you earn the **Ghostwalker role**. This allows you to hold any number of NFTs on your account without restrictions.

You can hold any number of NFTs from the [DeFi Geeks Member Gen 1](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1k6gdkepvwhhhdt6tk0auvkvansd3muqy0p98yedgwwarvcycxh8sex8dsf) collection on your account. However, owning several doesn’t provide additional benefits and is generally recommended to keep only one.

# Attributes and Roles

Each NFT has a set of attributes that grant access to specific roles on the server, unlocking additional features and opportunities.

Many attributes are still undisclosed, and owners of the first and second collections have the ability to propose ideas and approve them through community voting. Each user can have multiple roles on the server.

The attributes of each NFT are displayed on its page beneath the image.

# Alchemist
Activated by Attribute: Cosmic Pump Potion
![Image](https://i.postimg.cc/bJ950mVD/Alchemist.jpg)

Increases giveaway chances. If an Alchemist wins the #main-giveaway, he receive 6 additional tickets for any giveaways in the following month.
Also the **Alchemist** can select one additional role to receive the same 6 extra tickets for the next giveaways. 

Example: If the Alchemist grants the boost to the **Predictor** role, the **Predictor** will have 8 tickets (2 from its own attributes + 6 additional).

This boost for both roles is active for one month only and cannot trigger two months in a row. If the **Alchemist** wins the #main-giveaway again on next month, he simply claim the prize, and the boost does not activate.

Plus, Alchemist has privileges in IDO with access to allocations and a chance to win additional prizes.

Main Geek created a fund of 20,000 Eclipse to secure a guaranteed allocation of $500 and a chance to win an additional $1,250 through 16 tickets.

Ticket Distribution:
-  2 tickets – for **Gen1 members**
-  14 tickets – for holders of DeFi Geeks NFT

Owners of the **Alchemist** role receive 7 tickets first. If there are fewer tickets, they will be raffled among them. __If there are more tickets, the remaining ones will be randomly distributed among other NFT holders.__

Winners receive a mini-ticket, which grants the right to purchase a part of the IDO tokens. The tokens will be unlocked in stages: initially 20-30%, with the remainder gradually released over the next few months. You can buy tokens right away, and the rest will be distributed later.

To receive an allocation in Eclipse, you need to win twice: once in our giveaway and once in the distribution on the Eclipse platform. If you're lucky both times, you will need to transfer ~10-25 USDC to Main Geek to redeem the tokens. You won’t need to go through KYC or freeze funds — Main Geek has already done that for you.
